# Themi's drone/fixed wing controller testing

You can plug your controller in and directly test each channel right in your browser!

## Demo it at https://themis3000.github.io/Controller-testing

## Or insert it into your own website using the following iframe:

`<iframe src="https://themis3000.github.io/Controller-testing" width="300" height="500"></iframe>`

Works with every mainstream browser, even mobile browsers. Currently has compatablity issues with safari though, soon to be fixed
